Hey reader! 

I've created this blog to share my experiences with you as I attempt to learn design from scratch. As someone who considers themselves to be a software engineer and data scientist, this is an uncomfortable space for me to be in.

I'll be documenting my struggles and also sharing my small wins with you as I go on this wild adventure of discovering Design. I'm hoping through this, others can find parallels and be motivated to learn about design in similar ways.

> **You may be wondering, how am I learning design?**
> I'm enrolled in a designer-run school called Department of Illusions (DOI). This is started by [Devin Mancuso](https://dev.in/) whoâ€™s vision for the school is an educational space built upon the idea of students operating as a micro-community, in which they can develop not just their understanding of design but also the social and political environments in which their designs take place.

To understand the context of this blog for me, I must share a little about myself. I'm [Fady](https://fadyazmy.github.io/), a student at Western University in Canada, and I love to work on side projects relating to human relationships or sustainability. When I'm not on Stack Overflow, I'm busy dancing West Coast Swing or working with my community (more on that later) to re-discover my Egyptian identity.

I have been curious about [cybersecurity](https://web.archive.org/web/20161126232756/http://www.westerncyber.club/), [non-profits](https://developersfoundation.ca) and most recently [Quantum Machine Learning/Computing](https://www.creativedestructionlab.com/2018/07/creative-destruction-lab-hosts-its-first-ever-quantum-hackathon/). For each topic, I've spent from 8 months - 2 years being a sponge, and adding as much value as I can to the space. 

Since last year, I've been struggling with figuring out the design of a side project that I'm passionate about and have been working on - [Thank You Trees](https://thankyoutrees.io).

Thank You Trees is a platform to create and share minimalist/climate conscious gifts with friends and family. I knew it was to focus on improving my design skills and language, ever since I've felt frustrated at my basic design tools that I am familiar with expressing myself with.
