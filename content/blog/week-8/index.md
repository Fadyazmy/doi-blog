### <a name="howAmIfeeling"></a> How I'm feeling so far
I'm feeling great this week. I was able to do some exercise at home (swallowed a fly while exercising in the backyard), did a [small launch of TYT](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6658729994803650560/) on Linkedin and [got interviewed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqDkV6JhbUg) about TYT as well. 

I've also been spending time this week reconnecting with friends. I'm horrible with maintaining a text conversation over a few days so I'm coordinating time to catch up over Hangouts.

### <a name="assignment"></a> The assignment for this week
This week we don't have an assignment to hand in. However we were put into groups to work on a group project in parallel to the individual assignments. 

For this group project, I was paired with [Paul Progby](https://paulbrophy.co.uk/), and another designer based in Australia. Paul's a brilliant full stack developer turned designer and he's based in the UK.

We were tasked with creating our own design agency (which we called Pretty Good Designers), work with a hypothetical client (cough Devin), and design a product for the Dept. of Illusions. 

Despite being in 3 time zones, I enjoy working in groups. I'm very much looking forward to building better relationships, and learning from my peers. 

### <a name="discussionTakeaways"></a> This week's discussion takeaways
Often I find myself learning about non-design things in the lecture, and this week was one of them. 

Devin found writing an email to himself on Friday evenings, helped him resume work easier on Monday. It should take you max 30 mins on Friday, but it can save you more than that on Monday.

I also learnt that it's okay to build a story around your proto-personas during a white board interview. I remember during last week's mock interview, I had listed a couple of points for Alex and Jenny (my proto-persona couple) but it felt very Frankenstein-like to keep on adding points to a list that represented a story. So nevertheless it made the interview a bit less empathetic than I had hoped for.
