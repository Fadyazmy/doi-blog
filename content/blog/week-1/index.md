### <a name="howAmIfeeling"></a> How I'm feeling so far
When I work on projects, I often want to start coding before making any plans because I just want to feel the rush and see that I'm making progress. Similarly, with week 1 at DOI, I just wanted to start designing and get my hands dirty. However, I'm thankful we didn't start designing yet because these last 3 weeks of college are getting a little challenging as the semester wraps up before finals. 

If you've read the previous week, I was toying with the idea of rediscovering my Arabic identity and how to tell my story. I decided to organise an Arabs in Tech panel at my university in the last week of March after talking to several people who shared the same feelings. To my knowledge, this is the first event of its kind at any campus in Canada, so I'm pretty excited about this! 

One of my professors asked if he could schedule a [Thank You Tree](https://thankyoutrees.io) in advance and if there could be pictures included in the gift description. This is my second unsolicited customer, so I'm super excited to learn what his interests and needs are.

### <a name="assignment"></a> The assignment for this week
The assignment for this week focuses on figuring out our goals and what we hope to get out of the design school. I guess in other words, it's asking what our story is, and how can this school help us with where we want to take it (story extension).

The questions we were asked for week 2 are the following (fill them out yourself before looking at my answers!): 

>### My Goals
>1. What do you want the peak of your career to look like?
>2. What do you hope to learn during the Department of Illusions?
>3. What do you want to achieve by completing this course? Document up to three goals and the actions that will help you to achieve those goals.

>### My Action Plan (pick one goal)
>1. What are the steps (the actions) that you will take to help you move towards your goal? List out all the actions that would need to be completed to achieve your goal, be specific. Mention 3 steps. 

>### Design how you will measure your goals
>1. Design how you will measure your goals

>### Create milestones for weeks 4, 8, and 12
>1. Create milestones to evaluate progress towards your goal. Milestones can help break a large goal into digestible chunks, helping you see a clear path forward.

### <a name="responses"></a> My responses

>### My Goals
>1. What do you want the peak of your career to look like?

My dream is to be a Product Manager at a high impact software company and also be a role model for others coming from non-target schools with little resources. Outside of work, I hope I invest my time and resources in mentoring local entrepreneurs and building inclusive communities for minorities (something I relate to).


>2. What do you hope to learn during the Department of Illusions?

I hope I can simply sit down one day, critique a problem like a professional designer and come up with a mock visual (if need be) that I can share and get feedback on. Just like with code. 

>3. What do you want to achieve by completing this course? Document up to three goals and the actions that will help you to achieve those goals.

1. My goal is to have a personal journal of my design progress
2. My goal is to create a small design portfolio of 2-3 designs that I am proud of:
    - Web: My personal project (thank you trees)
    - 1-2 class project(s)
3. My goal is to build relationships with everyone in my cohort, Devin, and my coach.

>### My Action Plan (pick one goal)
>1. What are the steps (the actions) that you will take to help you move towards your goal? List out all the actions that would need to be completed to achieve your goal, be specific. Mention 3 steps. 


**Selected goal:**

Goal #2 - create a small design portfolio of 2-3 designs that I am proud of.

**The actions I will take to help me achieve this goal are:**
1. Be on top of school and assignments. No procrastination.
2. Commit to specific hours throughout the week for DOI work. Consider streaming on Twitch to enforce a commitment?
3. Staying healthy, work out at least two times a week.


>### Design how you will measure your goals
>1. Design how you will measure your goals

<!-- TODO: ask if he'd like to be mentioned -->
I will know when Iâ€™m making progress when my coach is happy with my progress.

>### Create milestones for weeks 4, 8, and 12
>1. Create milestones to evaluate progress towards your goal. Milestones can help break a large goal into digestible chunks, helping you see a clear path forward.

**The specific, measurable results I will produce by Week 4 are:**
  - completed wireframe sketches for ThankYouTrees (TYT) homepage
  - get feedback on the homepage

**The specific, measurable results I will produce by Week 8 are:**
- completed the case study for TYT (including home and gifts pages) 
- written out all the content and images for the case study in a google doc
- gotten feedback on the content and images
- set up the portfolio on a chosen platform (custom/Jekyll/Webflow etc.)

**The specific, measurable results I will produce by Week 12 are:**
- completed a second case study project gotten feedback on all the content and images 
- uploaded the case study on the portfolio website

### <a name="assignmentTakeaways"></a> This week's assignment takeaways
If you haven't already realised, my dear reader, you are going to be my guinea pig for the next 12 weeks. Since English isn't my first language, and I know my effective writing skills often hold me back from expressing delicate feelings and ideas. I plan to change this with a weekly high-quality journal entry that reflects my work, thoughts, feelings and my learnings. I welcome all and any feedback on how I could improve my effective writing skills (or what you are interested in learning about) :) 

As I was coming up with my goals for this week's assignment, I asked myself, "If I had a magic wand, what would I wish to achieve at design school?". Interestingly, I could only think of my struggle when dealing with my lack of design understanding and communication.

For example, when working on ThankYouTrees, I know where the user experience feels wrong, but I usually can't put my finger on it, let alone explain to designer friends my design thinking process of what I am trying to achieve. 

Other than my intentions to build a small design portfolio, I know the rest of my goals could be more design specific. However, I'm trying to embrace that I am not a designer yet, so I don't know what beginner-middle stage designers are thinking about for their goals now. I have to make sense of everything that I am exposed to, with the tools I have (building relationships/better writing plus be the best sponge I can be).

**New word(s) I learnt:**
- Secret Cabal - a group of people promoting their views/agenda without the org knowing.

### <a name="discussionTakeaways"></a> This week's discussion takeaways 
Devin started this week's discussion with the question of 'What is Design?'. As someone who comes from a non-design background, I'm aware I am a consumer (and sometimes the builder) of (wo)man-made experiences.

During my time running a tech consulting [non-profit](https://developersfoundation.ca) for charities, design to me meant communication. Specifically, how can we communicate the vision and story of the charity to the online visitors on their new website, so they convert to online donors.

We also briefly discussed **'what does responsible design mean?'**, perhaps framed differently (but not the same), what is the responsibility of a designer? 

> Our role as designers, is to be the gatekeepers. We are responsible for those using our products.

This made me wonder why designers don't go through an ethics ceremony similar to how engineers and doctors do. I'd argue the repercussions of Netflix's design patterns are significant to a lot of people's health. I found an interesting resource showing a hall of shame [examples](https://twitter.com/darkpatterns).

Update: my team and I canceled the Arabs In Tech event because of the covid-19 virus. Stay tuned for what's next :)
