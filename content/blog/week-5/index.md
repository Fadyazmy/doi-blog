### <a name="howAmIfeeling"></a> How I'm feeling so far

This week is the last week of school, so all my courses are wrapping up. I'm feeling a little anxious as there's a lot happening at home at the moment (not-health related), Thank You Trees is picking up as friends/family are starting to use it/request features (\$300 in sales!), and I'm not putting in the time I want to for this course. So I made the decision to drop one course which I couldn't get an accomodation for a deadline extension. Due to covid-19, this course substituted a midterm for 2 long assignments, which broke my planning and commitments. This was a hard decision to make, but it came down to my belief that it's better to do a couple of things well rather than many things not so well.

I also got to meet with Paul and Fiza from my cohort as part of this week's assignment. This was refreshing, especially now when human contact is rare, to make new friends and learn about their story/thought process behind their case.

I also secured a guest speaker for this week's class (everyone is assigned a week to bring a guest speaker of their choice). I am a huge fan of good storytelling. I find there's little difference between Pixar story telling through motion pictures and someone storytelling an experience they had.

Salim Sader is the co-founder of Goalcast, which is a story telling expert production house for 5-10 mins videos (~500M video views per month).

### <a name="assignment"></a> The assignment for this week

This week's assignment is about communication. We'll practice communicating our design thinking of our work and provide feedback to peers regarding their presentation.

> "You can have the most innovative design in the world, but if no one on your team understands what you’re trying to do, it’s never going to leave your Figma file", Devin

1. It’s time to practice presenting your design rationale and decision making. Find another student to team up with, you’ll both practice presenting one piece of work from your portfolio to each other.

2. Then it’s time to broaden that audience! Record a Loom video walking us through 1 piece of work from your portfolio.

### <a name="responses"></a> My responses

I struggled with this week's assigmment a bit because I wasn't sure what would an appropriate design presentation be like. I've presented my logic from a product/business/tech perspective before, but design was a first.

This is my response video presenting the project I'm currently working on [Thank You Trees](https://thankyoutrees.io):

My format for this video was:

- Self introduction
- Problem
- (pain points)
- Solution brief
- My role
- User personas (x3)
- Demo
- 3 design decision (Contribution, Gift page, carbon sequestration)

### <a name="assignmentTakeaways"></a> This week's assignment takeaways

Something new I learnt was the importance of involving stakeholders early in the process. It doesn’t matter how flashy a design can be, because it might not be what the stakeholder wants.

This knowledge helps validate an assumption I had that visuals isn’t what will win the task. Extending this point further, I believe an but functional visual that is acceptable by stakeholders is worth more than a best in class-visual which is not accepted by stakeholders.

There is an opportunity here for me to learn and be conscious of how to seek/use customer feedback so that new designs/features are praised by community. An area I want to investigate deeper is coming up with a process to request and consolidate feedback from community and different stakeholders.

Areas of improvement:

- Expand on how the personas connect (add a slide to show conclusions of commonality)
- Include visuals in the product presentation to highlight features, before showcasing the demo

### <a name="discussionTakeaways"></a> This week's discussion takeaways

I found that I learnt a lot from [re-doing](https://www.loom.com/share/69f1335d3349484c95812ab787b308c5) my assignments. Practice makes perfect, and even after learning CS/programming it's difficult to re-accept that rule.

During our lecture we discussed what **_good design_** is. Good design is agnostic of how flashy/visually appealing a solution might seem, it has to:

1. Solves a problem
2. Be usable, easy for users
3. Everyone must be behind it - supported by all stakeholders

It was also refreshing to go over the importance of articulation. This reminder was a bit personal for me, because I initially joined CS because of my weak articulation/design skills to share concepts/ideas with friends. Articulation is important because it:
- Shows intelligence
- Demonstrates intentionality ("they really thought about this.. huh")
- Expresses confidence (not wishy washy, know next steps)
- Shows respect (you value peoples time because you are prepared)

Devin also shared some tips on how to handle meetings effectively:
>> There's a 'meeting after the meeting':
- The informal social gathering after the meeting, maybe more important than the meeting itself?
- Try to be last to leave
- Don’t go for lunch immediately
- Sometimes people are quite in the meeting and want to talk in private
- Manager might be there, so their role is just to listen
  - Don't voice their opinions for time/other reasons
- Give candid feedback (allies give you good advice)
- Send a follow up email 1 hour later. This demonstrates the meeting was a priority, you value the meeting and the participants.

On a similar note, I've been reading about workforce productivity and management styles lately and I found some of Amazon's work relevant to my learnings. For example Amazon [structures meetings around 6 page memos](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/beauty-amazons-6-pager-brad-porter/) and they operate (and also hire based) on their [Leadership Principles](https://www.amazon.jobs/en/principles).
