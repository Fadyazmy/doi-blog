### <a name="howAmIfeeling"></a> How I'm feeling so far

This week has been busy. We finally sold our house because the builders have resumed construction (during a virus pandemic, I know) which put my family at an awkward mortgage spot. As much as I am busy with working on Thank You Trees, design and my personal health, I am trying to also be present at home.

A Thank You Trees user asked if they could collaborate more with their friends before sharing the gift with their crossfit coach. This meant including an optional message with every gift contribution and also changing the layout so that all messages are given almost equal importance. They referenced the analogy of gift cards, where the gift recipient doesn't know who wrote the first message and everyone feels they are on an equal footing.

### <a name="assignment"></a> The assignment for this week

Put the Design Exercise Canvas into practice! This week you’ll be using your 1:1 call with your coach to take on a remote product design whiteboard challenge.

Note: the Design Exercise Canvas is a framework [Devin](https:/dev.in) put together to help give structure to whiteboard design exercises.

Devin mentioned he plans to share it publicly when he feels it's polished enough, but in the meantime the general structure is: Why, Who, Context, User Pain, What, CUJs (Customer User Journeys) and Task Model.

### <a name="responses"></a> My responses

This was my most challenging assignment so far. I didn't record my response with my coach but I did ask if I could share some of the feedback he gave me at the end of my interview.

#### Design challenge:
> Design a robo-dog companion application

#### What I did well:
- Asked good questions (compatible previous version, cross platforms, success metrics
- Replaying the information / conclusions
- User personas
    - good at refining e.g. asking about who buys
    -  Proto-personas (Alex and Jenny)
- Communicating assumptions
- Replaying where we are at
- User stories -> Technical requirements 

#### What I could have done better:
- My start was a bit shaky / slow start 
- Was a little hard to follow the structure. I should be more direct i.e “I’m going to walk through a framework"
- Inclusive? Be more “inclusive” and broad about users
- List use cases as they come up in conversation
- From a user story perspective, think of the beginning (onboarding) -> middle (daily use) ->  end
- Its okay to think a little (silence) 
- Can ask questions about who you will be working with / team sizes etc.
- Go beyond the UI and think about the system / unintended consequences etc. 
- Get to the UI (ran out of time)


### <a name="assignmentTakeaways"></a> This week's assignment takeaways

I learnt that I need to ask friends to practice whiteboard design questions with. It's sounds simple, but I didn't feel comfortable asking my design peers because I was worried I couldn't add as much value to them as they would with me. In hindsight, I think I should have tried harder to not act like a black sheep and embrace the fact that I'm a beginner and engage with everyone. 

In preparation for the interview I spent a couple of hours watching mock design videos on YouTube, but I don't think it helped me get comfortable with the interview format.

Fortunately I was already familiar with this type of product design question from my experience in Product Management interviews. However, I was a bit nervous of giving a PM answer rather than a Design answer (there's a LOT of overlap) so I struggled in the beginning of my interview to find my footing. Finding the right tone, and the appropriate level/type of detail that I should be communicating occupied my attention the most.

### <a name="discussionTakeaways"></a> This week's discussion takeaways

Im this week's lecture we mainly discussed the whiteboard challenge. Devin took us step by step of through the process of what a whiteboard design interview should be. 

It was also interesting to see how remote white board challenges can make the interview a little harder (at least in my opinion) if you're using Figma vs drawing on a real whiteboard in front of the interviewers.

UPDATE (May 20th, week 12): Now that I have used Figma for a couple of my assignments, I'm certain that I've produced better designs using Figma than any of my paper/whiteboard designs that I've created in my career. 

Do designers need to be good at drawing? I'm not sure anymore.
