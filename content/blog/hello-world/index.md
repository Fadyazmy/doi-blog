Hey reader! 

I've created this blog to share my experiences with you as I attempt to learn design from scratch. As someone who considers themself to be a software engineer/data scientist, I know this is an uncomfortable space to be in, especially since I've been struggling with designing even my own projects so far. 

I'll be documenting my struggles and also sharing my small wins with you as I go on this wild adventure of discovering Design. I'm hoping through this, others can find parallels and be motivated to learn about design their own way.

> I'm enrolled in an experimental design school called Department of Illusions. This is started by [Devin Mancuso](https://dev.in/) who's vision for the school is to xxxx

To really understand the conext of this blog for me, I must share a little about myself. I'm Fady, a student at Western University in Canada, and I love to work on side projects relating to human relationships / sustainability when I'm not busy dancing West Coast Swing. 

I have been curious about [cybersecurity](https://web.archive.org/web/20161126232756/http://www.westerncyber.club/), [non-profits](https://developersfoundation.ca) and most recently [Quantum Computing](https://www.creativedestructionlab.com/2018/07/creative-destruction-lab-hosts-its-first-ever-quantum-hackathon/). For each topic, I've spent from 8 months - 2 years being a sponge, and adding as much value as I can give. 

I've been struggling with design a lot lately, as I have been spending time working on my side project [Thank You Trees](https://thankyoutrees.io) to  Thank You Gifts meaningful, accessibly. This struggle has made self-aware that I need to improve on my design skills. Be it, for customer interviews, spining up draft mockups and even understanding user experience.
