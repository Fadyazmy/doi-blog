Hey reader! I've created this blog to mainly share my experience with learning design from scratch. I will admit here, that my go-to design style is stick figures.

I'll be documenting my struggles and also sharing my wins with you as I go on this wild adventure of discovering Design. 

> You may be wondering how am I learning design? 
I met [Devin Mancuso](https://google.com) through a mutual friend, who happened to be starting a open source design school called the Department of Illusions (DOI). I think Devin was mainly looking for designers and how to help them be better, but I think after speaking with me, he saw something that was worth taking the risk. For that I am trully grateful. 




Oh, and here's a great quote from this Wikipedia on
[salted duck eggs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salted_duck_egg).

> A salted duck egg is a Chinese preserved food product made by soaking duck
> eggs in brine, or packing each egg in damp, salted charcoal. In Asian
> supermarkets, these eggs are sometimes sold covered in a thick layer of salted
> charcoal paste. The eggs may also be sold with the salted paste removed,
> wrapped in plastic, and vacuum packed. From the salt curing process, the
> salted duck eggs have a briny aroma, a gelatin-like egg white and a
> firm-textured, round yolk that is bright orange-red in color.
